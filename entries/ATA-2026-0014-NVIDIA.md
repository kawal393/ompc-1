## 1. THE TITAN
* **Name:** NVIDIA Corporation
* **Sector:** AI Infrastructure / Computing Platforms
* **Document:** 2025 Annual Review (Fiscal Year 2025)
* **Audience:** Global Stakeholders / "NVIDIANs" / Sovereign Nations

## 2. THE CLAIM (VERBATIM)
> "AI factories are a new class of infrastructure, transforming data into tokens of intelligence."
* **Source:** Page 5, 2025 Annual Review

## 3. THE APEX DECOMPRESSION
NVIDIA has officially exited the "Chip" business and entered the **"Intelligence Manufacturing"** business. By defining data centers as "AI Factories," they are rebranding the act of computing into a commodity production cycle. The "Token" is now the atomic unit of value—the "currency of the AI age." NVIDIA is positioning itself as the sole provider of the "thinking machines" that generate this currency. They are signaling a transition from **Retrieval-Based Computing** (looking things up) to **Generative Computing** (creating thoughts in real-time). This is the blueprint for the $100 trillion global economy's transition to a synthetic substrate.

## 4. THE PREDICTION
* **Timeline:** 2025-2026 (The "Blackwell" Ramp)
* **Outcome:** We predict the "Inference Explosion." As Blackwell delivers 30x faster inference at 25x lower cost, the world will shift from training models to running "Agentic AI" at massive scale. NVIDIA will capture trillions in infrastructure spend as nations race to build "Sovereign AI Factories" to manufacture their own national intelligence tokens.

## 5. STATUS
* **Classification:** ACTIVE TRACKING
* **Proof of Reality:** Track the "Blackwell" revenue ramp in 2026 (forecasted to be the fastest in history) and the percentage of revenue derived from "Physical AI" and "Autonomous Machines."
