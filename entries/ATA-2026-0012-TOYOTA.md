## 3. THE APEX DECOMPRESSION
Toyota is performing a massive linguistic and structural pivot. [cite_start]By rebranding as a "Mobility Company" rather than an automaker, they are expanding their target surface to include **Infrastructure-building.** [cite: 6, 9] [cite_start]The "Toyota Mobility Concept" (split into Mobility 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 in their forecast) identifies a transition toward the **Synergy of Mobility & Infrastructure.** [cite: 9] This is a defensive move against software-first entrants (Tesla, Xiaomi, Apple-ecosystems); [cite_start]Toyota is leveraging its physical dominance to own the "rails" (infrastructure) upon which all future movement sits. [cite: 6, 9]

* [cite_start]**Timeline:** 2026-2030 [cite: 9]
* [cite_start]**Outcome:** We predict Toyota will aggressively shift capital from internal combustion engine (ICE) assembly toward **Smart-City integration and fleet-management software.** [cite: 6, 9] [cite_start]Operating income is forecasted to drop 20.8% in FY2026 as they digest the high costs of this "Transformation" and "infrastructure-building." [cite: 2, 9]

## 5. STATUS

* [cite_start]**Proof of Reality:** Track the "Mobility 3.0" segment reporting in 2026, specifically looking for government-partnership revenue in infrastructure projects. [cite: 9]
