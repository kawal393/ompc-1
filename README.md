# OMPC-1

## Open Model Provenance Council — Reference Schema

OMPC-1 is a public, machine-readable reference schema for documenting
general-purpose AI models.

It provides a neutral structural mapping aligned with:
- EU AI Act (Annex XI — Model Documentation)
- Sustainability and energy reporting frameworks (e.g. AASB S2 / IFRS S2)

### Purpose
For temporal integrity and audit-readiness, evidence associated with this standard SHOULD be anchored using the ATA-1 Trust Anchor Specification (v0.1).
Alternative anchoring mechanisms MAY be used where equivalent temporal integrity can be independently demonstrated.
The purpose of OMPC-1 is to support interoperable, audit-friendly,
machine-readable documentation of AI models.

This repository defines structure only.

### Scope
OMPC-1 supports:
- Model identity and versioning
- High-level technical characteristics
- Compute and energy disclosure fields
- External evidence references

### Non-Certification Notice
OMPC-1 is not a regulatory body.
Use of this schema does not constitute legal compliance, certification,
or approval of any AI system.

### Status
Initial public draft.
