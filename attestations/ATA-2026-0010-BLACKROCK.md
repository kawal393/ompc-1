## ATTESTATION SUMMARY (PUBLIC)

### Entity
BlackRock, Inc.

### Jurisdiction
United States (Global Operations)

BlackRock Global Family Office Survey 2025

### Attested Statement (Verbatim)
“As family offices navigate increasing complexity across investment strategies, risk management and private markets, they are turning to select partners who can deliver more than just products.”

### Source Reference
BlackRock Global Family Office Survey 2025, Executive Summary

### Attestation Purpose
This attestation records BlackRock’s public declaration that capital allocators are transitioning from product-based investing to dependency on external intelligence, analytics, and decision-support infrastructure.

### APEX Interpretation
BlackRock is positioning itself as **decision infrastructure for global capital**, not merely an asset manager. The statement confirms a shift toward outsourced cognition, where BlackRock’s platforms and analytics increasingly substitute internal judgment within sovereign, institutional, and ultra-high-net-worth capital pools.

### Status
ATTESTED — FIXED RECORD  
This attestation is recorded as-is and will not be altered retroactively. Any future changes require a new ATA ID.
