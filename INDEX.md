# APEX Global Ledger — 2026

## Purpose
The APEX Global Ledger is an independent registry for documenting publicly disclosed AI systems, governance statements, and risk-related disclosures made by large organizations.

The Ledger exists to create a timestamped, neutral record of what has been publicly stated about AI use and governance at a given point in time.

## Scope
APEX entries are based solely on publicly available documents such as:
- Annual reports
- Sustainability reports
- Regulatory filings
- Public policy statements

No private data is used.
## Record Anchor

GitHub commit history is the canonical timestamp for all ledger entries.

## Two-Layer Structure
Each APEX entry follows a two-layer model:

### Layer A — Attestation (Public)
- Records that a document exists
- Extracts direct quotes or factual statements
- Makes no claim about accuracy or compliance
- Contains no legal or risk judgment

### Layer B — Assessment (Private)
- Applies an internal risk analysis framework
- Identifies disclosure gaps and uncertainty
- Is not published publicly
- Is provided separately for insurance and underwriting evaluation

## Audit State
All public entries are classified as:
**Surface Pass Only**

APEX does not certify, validate, or guarantee compliance.
APEX does not provide legal or financial advice.

## Independence
APEX is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to any audited organization.

The Ledger is maintained independently for documentation and risk-evaluation purposes.
